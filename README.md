## üí∞ Cost of Usage & Monetization

This Actor is monetized using the **Pay-per-result (PPR)** model.

- **Actor Price:** **$0.50 per 1,000 successfully analyzed profiles**.
- **Apify Platform Costs:** In addition to the Actor's price, you will also be charged for Apify platform usage costs (such as Residential Proxy usage and Compute Units).

You only pay for profiles that are successfully processed and return data. Profiles that result in an error after all retries are not counted towards the cost.
